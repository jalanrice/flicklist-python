        Each of these list items should contain a form that submits to /ratings
        The form should contain:
            - label that says "My Rating"
            - a dropdown menu with 6 options:
                - "How was it?"
                - *
                - **
                - ***
                - ****
                - *****
            - a hidden input to tell the back-end which movie we are rating
            - a submit button that says "Rate it!"
        -->
